# Weather Dashboard

A weather dashboard application that will allow users to see the weather outlook for a city they search, including a 5 day forecast.

## Description
I have built a weather dashoard with form inputs, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS. This makes use of the [5 Day Weather Forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)

## Process
* Sign up for an API key on the OpenWeather API website

* Explore the API documentation to get an idea of the different types of data you can retrieve, as well as the API endpoints

* Set up development environment

* Create a basic HTML/CSS layout

* Fetch data from the OpenWeather API using JavaScript. The API key is required to make API requests

* Display the current weather data: Use JavaScript to display the current weather data including things like the current temperature, the current, humidity and wind speed.

* Display the five-day forecast data: Use JavaScript to display the five-day forecast data by looping through an array of data.

* Adjust JavaScript to store history and append this so user can easily view city choices

* Finally, adjust CSS so the app looks more user friendly.

## Usage

  * Search for a city in the form input

  * You will then be presented with current and future conditions for that city 

  * City is also then added to the search history as buttons on the side so you can click on them to get the information again for the selected city

  * When you view the current weather conditions for that city, you will see:

    * City name
    * Date
    * Icon representation of weather conditions
    * Temperature
    * Humidity
    * Wind speed 
    <br> </br>

  * The 5-day forecast displays: 
    * Date
    * Icon representation of weather conditions
    * Temperature
    * Humidity

## Additional notes

The most challenging part of this task was getting the 5 day forecast to work right and making sure my code wan't missing any brackets given how much detail was going into the script.js file. 

I had to step away a few times and revisit, but eventually tackled the code line by line and with a bit of googling, browser inspecting and patience, I found where the issue was coming from and resolved.
