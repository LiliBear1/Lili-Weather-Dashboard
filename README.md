# Weather Dashboard

A weather dashboard application that will allow users to see the weather outlook for a city they search, including a 5 day forecast.

## Description
I have built a weather dashoard with form inputs, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS. This makes use of the [5 Day Weather Forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)

## Process



## Usage
  * Search for a city in the form input

  * You will then be presented with current and future conditions for that city 

  * City is also then added to the search history

  * When you view the current weather conditions for that city, you will see:

    * City name
    * Date
    * Icon representation of weather conditions
    * Temperature
    * Humidity
    * Wind speed 
    <br> </br>

  * The 5-day forecast displays: 
    * Date
    * Icon representation of weather conditions
    * Temperature
    * Humidity
    <br> </br>

## Additional notes

The most challenging part of this task was getting the 5 day forecast to work right and making sure my code wan't missing any brackets given how much detail was going into the script.js file. 

I had to step away a few times and revisit, but eventually tackled the code line by line and with a bit of googling, browser inspecting and patience, I found where the issue was coming from and resolved.
